# Repo for Jeff Underhill at AWS as follow-up to Summit Toronto 2023 "chaulk talk" question

You asked for the steps with which I take to create a plain vanilla compiled-from-source, from PHP's Github source repo. Please see the "make_php_runtime.sh" in this repo.

- Overall steps from this AWS Compute Blog post, Dec 2018, when Lambda Layers & Runtime API announced [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/aws-lambda-custom-runtime-for-php-a-practical-example/](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/aws-lambda-custom-runtime-for-php-a-practical-example/)
- The bootsrap file is from [https://github.com/aws-samples/php-examples-for-aws-lambda/blob/master/0.1-SimplePhpFunction/bootstrap](https://github.com/aws-samples/php-examples-for-aws-lambda/blob/master/0.1-SimplePhpFunction/bootstrap)

Thank you for travelling to Toronto to do your excellent Chaulk Talk!
